# Vanguard Service Control Script

This batch script allows you to start, stop, disable, and set the `vgc` service to manual on a Windows system. It requires administrator privileges to execute certain commands, such as stopping, disabling, or changing the service's startup type.

## Prerequisites

- **Windows Operating System**: The script is designed to work on Windows.
- **Administrator Privileges**: The script must be run with administrator privileges to perform actions on the `vgc` service.

## Usage

### Running the Script

1. **Running with Administrator Privileges**:

   - **Option 1**: Right-click on the script (`vanguard.bat`) and select **Run as administrator**.
   - **Option 2**: Create a shortcut to the script, then right-click on the shortcut, go to **Properties**, click on **Advanced**, and check the **Run as administrator** box.

2. **Command-Line Arguments**:

   - The script accepts the following command-line arguments:
     - `start` - Starts the `vgc` service.
     - `stop` - Stops the `vgc` service.
     - `disable` - Disables the `vgc` service, preventing it from being started manually or automatically.
     - `enable` - Sets the `vgc` service to manual start, allowing it to be started manually but not automatically.

   Example usage:

   ```
   vanguard.bat start
   vanguard.bat stop
   vanguard.bat disable
   vanguard.bat enable
   ```

### Script Behavior

**Argument Parsing**: The script checks the provided argument and executes the corresponding action:

- `start` - The script attempts to start the `vgc` service.
- `stop` - The script attempts to stop the `vgc` service.
- `disable` - The script disables the `vgc` service.
- `enable` - The script sets the `vgc` service to manual start.

**Error Handling**:

- If the service fails to start, stop, disable, or set to manual, the script will output an appropriate error message.
- If an invalid argument is provided, the script will display usage instructions.

### Sample Output

- **Start the Service**:

```
Command-line argument: start
Start argument detected.
Attempting to start vgc...
vgc started successfully.
```

- **Stop the Service**:

```
Command-line argument: stop
Stop argument detected.
Attempting to stop vgc...
vgc stopped successfully.
```

- **Disable the Service**:

```
Command-line argument: disable
Disable argument detected.
Attempting to disable vgc...
vgc disabled successfully.
```

- **Set the Service to Manual (Enable)**:

```
Command-line argument: manual
Manual argument detected.
Attempting to set vgc to manual...
vgc set to manual successfully.
```

## Troubleshooting

**Access Denied Error**:

- If you encounter an "Access Denied" error when attempting to stop, disable, or modify the service, ensure that the script is run with administrator privileges.

**Script Fails to Run as Administrator**:

- Ensure that you right-click the script and select **Run as administrator**, or create a shortcut with the **Run as administrator** option enabled.
